1. Unzip eBay_Node.tar.gz
2. Go into the eBay_Node directory.
3. Run the command "npm install"
4. In the test.json, replace your own id, devid, key to origin information.
5. In the Line 42, index.js, if you want to run in the PRODUCTION mode, replace it. And SANDBOX mode, replace too!!!
   The normal option is PRODUCTION.
6. Run the command "node index.js" in the current directory.

You could see the results!!!
